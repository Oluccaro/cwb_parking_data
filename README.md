# ðŸš€ Starting the Setup

## Step 1: Start the PostGIS Instance and `osm2pgsql` Image
To begin, start the necessary services by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The data weâ€™ll be using is located in the `map.osm` file, which contains information about a small region from Curitiba.

---

## Step 2: Import the Data

Navigate to the `/data` folder and make the `run_import.sh` script executable:

```bash
chmod +x run_import.sh
```

Now you can run the import script:

```bash
./run_import.sh <file_name>
```

- **Note:** The `<file_name>` argument is optional. If you specify it, the script will import the data from that file in the `/map-data` directory. If omitted, it will default to importing `map.osm`.

Alternatively, you can run the following command directly from your terminal (while inside the `/data` directory):

```bash
docker compose run -v $(pwd)/map-data:/data osm2pgsql \
  -d osm \    
  -U osmuser \
  -H postgis \
  -P 5432 \             
  -c -k /data/map.osm
```

## Expected Output

If everything works correctly, you should see output similar to this:

```
2024-10-07 07:07:08  All postprocessing on table 'planet_osm_point' done in 0s.
2024-10-07 07:07:08  All postprocessing on table 'planet_osm_line' done in 0s.
2024-10-07 07:07:08  All postprocessing on table 'planet_osm_polygon' done in 0s.
2024-10-07 07:07:08  All postprocessing on table 'planet_osm_roads' done in 0s.
2024-10-07 07:07:08  Storing properties to table '"public"."osm2pgsql_properties"'.
2024-10-07 07:07:08  osm2pgsql took 0s overall.
```

## Step 3: Access the PostgreSQL Database

Once the import is done, you can access the PostgreSQL database running in Docker using the username and password youâ€™ve configured. Feel free to use your preferred method to connect.

## Example Query to Test

Hereâ€™s a SQL query you can run to test the imported data:

```sql
-- Replace 'StreetName' with the name of the street you're interested in
SELECT p.*
FROM planet_osm_polygon p
JOIN planet_osm_roads r
  ON r.name = 'Rua Conselheiro Laurindo' -- Replace with the actual street name
WHERE ST_DWithin(r.way, p.way, 120)      -- 120 meters buffer zone around the road
AND p.amenity = 'parking'                -- only parking polygons
AND p.tags->'parking' = 'street_side';   -- only street-side parking
```

Feel free to download new datasets to further test the setup.
